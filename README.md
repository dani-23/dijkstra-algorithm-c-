# dijkstra-algorithm-c-
An implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm using C++.

Dijkstra is an algorithm that gives you the shortest path between two nodes. It is worth noticing that this algorithm is more reliable for graphs where the edges have a cost/weight associated.
I used heaps for this implementation for a better efficiency.
